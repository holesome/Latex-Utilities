# LaTeX Utilities

Repository consisting of all my LaTeX related files.

## Qurʾān Chapters

Shortcut file for all the chapters of the Qurʾān. UTF-8 symbols were not used to ensure that it is backwards-compatible with pdfLaTeX.

## KFGQPC Symbols

KFGQPC stand for `King Fahad Glorious Qurʾān Printing Complex` and they have released a font consisting of Arabic calligraphic glyphs. This aims to make it easier to reference them and use them in XeLaTeX and Microsoft Word.
